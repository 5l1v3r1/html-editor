# Live HTML Editor


This is a simple real-time html editor, for very small tests and things like this with html/css/javascript. It was made just for fun, to test some functionalities of html elements, libraries like [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) (which was used to make the writing zone) and fulfill my need to make a 'home-made' tool for fast html test.

## Features:

- Code highlight;
- Auto-close tags and brackets;
- Real-time code rendering;
- Some features will be added in the future :-P
